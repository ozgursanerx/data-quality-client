# Product Context: Flowlytics

## Why Flowlytics Exists

Data warehouse teams face significant challenges in maintaining data flow visibility and understanding data processing:

- **Manual Analysis**: Time-consuming manual investigation of data flow issues
- **Limited Visibility**: Difficulty tracing data dependencies across complex ETL processes  
- **Reactive Approach**: Problems discovered after impacting downstream systems
- **Fragmented Tools**: Multiple disconnected tools for different aspects of data management
- **Complex Dependencies**: Understanding relationships between packages, procedures, and steps

The Flowlytics platform provides a comprehensive, visual solution for proactive data flow management, transforming how teams monitor, analyze, and maintain their data warehouse operations.

## Problems Flowlytics Solves

### 1. Data Flow Visibility Gap
**Problem**: Data flow issues are discovered too late, after impacting business operations

**Solution**: Real-time monitoring with interactive data lineage visualization
- Proactive anomaly detection with configurable thresholds
